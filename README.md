# App Store Frontend Simulation 

## üöÄ Project Summary 

This project is a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) designed to simulate the core functionalities of a mobile application store. It features multiple views for browsing, searching, and managing app installations, with data persistence handled via **LocalStorage**. The application emphasizes a clean user interface, efficient state management, and an enhanced user experience with loading animations and data visualization.
